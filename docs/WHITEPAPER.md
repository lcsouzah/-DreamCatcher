DreamCatcher: A Sleep-to-Earn Protocol

Abstract
DreamCatcher is a decentralized protocol that rewards individuals for healthy sleep patterns using blockchain-based incentives.
By leveraging passive data from mobile sensors, users are compensated in $DREAM tokens for participating in a system that values rest and wellbeing. 
The network operates without central control, governed instead by the participants who contribute to and benefit from its growth.

Introduction
In traditional economic models, productivity is measured by wakeful activity. 
DreamCatcher redefines this notion by turning restful sleep into a productive, rewardable event. 
Participants contribute sleep data and receive proportional rewards based on duration, quality, and consistency.

Protocol Overview
The DreamCatcher app records sleep sessions through mobile devices, analyzing time and basic quality metrics. 
Upon verification, $DREAM tokens are issued as rewards. 
A staking and voting system empowers users to guide decisions on emission rates, app features, and future development priorities.

Incentive Model
Rewards are distributed on a tiered system calibrated to sleep duration and engagement. 
Token emissions are dynamically adjusted to maintain economic sustainability. 
All reward logic is transparent and subject to community governance.

Governance
DreamCatcher is governed by its community. 
$DREAM holders may propose and vote on protocol upgrades, tokenomic changes, or development roadmaps. 
This ensures a decentralized evolution of the ecosystem aligned with the values of its participants.

Conclusion
DreamCatcher presents a novel approach to health and value creation, transforming sleep into an asset
. It invites individuals to participate in a protocol where dreams are not only personalâ€”but productive.
